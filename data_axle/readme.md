Train Reservation System (TRS)

Assumptions:
1. Seats to be reserved in same cabin, it is assumed that seat number will be reserved in order
    i.e. reserved = 5 seats means numbers for this will be [1 2 3 4 5]

2. Initially all seats will be available.

3. seat reserved = 5  so available seats will be [5 6 7 8 9 10] if capacity (fc_available or sc_available) is 10
